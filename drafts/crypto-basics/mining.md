# Crypto Basics: Mining

Google Doc: todo

## Outline

- Intro: Explain mining in as simple terms as possible. Avoid jargon such as hash rates or POW.
- Ledger: Start by explaining a simple ledger and lead into the concept of a distributed ledger.
- Transactions: Show an example of a simple transaction.
- Security: Talk about why people can't just write their own transactions to the ledger willy nilly.
- Creating a secure transaction: Talk about how a sender can approve a transaction using a private key. One elegant way to talk about cryptography is to use a painting analogy.
- Validating transactions: Show how a miner helps verify that a transaction is valid and helps write it to the ledger.
- Rewards for validating a transaction: Talk about fees and newly minted tokens that go to the miner or a pool of miners.
- Types of mining: Briefly cover POW vs POS and some of the implications suchs as how they impact incentives and energy consumption.
- What you need to start mining: Talk a little bit about hardware + energy requirements. Maybe explain that trying to mine using a basic laptop is kind of like hitting the lottery.
- The future of mining: Talk about how mining is going to become more competitive over time as rewards drop, more miners come online, and POW becomes more challenging.
- Mining isn't for everyone: After people are aware that mining is an expensive and technically challenging hobby...talk about how crypto is usable by people who never touch a mining rig.
- Summary: Restate the important points.
