# Crypto Research: July 2021
todo: Summarize what happened in July 2021


## [Coinbase listing the first act in an industry-wide exit strategy](https://coingeek.com/coinbase-listing-the-first-act-in-an-industry-wide-exit-strategy/)
Reading this makes crypto sound a little like a house of cards overhyped and ready to collapse after all the major stakeholders cash out. 
There certainly are a few fat cats looking for an exit. Does this mean other major centralized exchanges such as Kraken are going to follow suit? We'll see. 
This could hurt crypto short term but maybe it's a good thing long term. Maybe this paves the way for decentral exchanges to get traction.

The part of the article covering Tether is very worrying. I need to do more research on stablecoins and the mechanics behind reserves and other strategies to stabilize.
