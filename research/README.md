# Crypto Research

This is a space to share crypto research. Say you've found a great article on smart contracts. You could copy and paste the URL into Discord/Email/Social, but that isn't usually very helpful for a few reasons:

1) People don't have time to read every link posted in every channel they monitor
2) A random URL doesn't convey enough information for someone to decide if the article is worth investing time on or not
3) This type of information sharing is usually 1:1, making it hard for a broader community to benefit from
4) Finding previously posted links for reference is really challenging if you have to dig through a mountain of chat history

It's better to post a link with either a TLDR or your hot take in a more organized space dedicated to research. You can simply browse this folder and see previous research and follow the same format to post your own research. Below is a more detailed description of the format.

1) Once you find an interesting article, video, or book on crypto, write either a very short TLDR which is basically a face value summary. Or if you have a strong opinion on the piece, write a hot take.
2) Find a folder for the year the content was published along with a file for the published month. If an article was published in July of 2021, the path should be coin-field-guide/research/2021/july.md. If the file doesn't exist, create a new one with format copies from a previous file.
3) Check to see if the article is already posted, if so add your TLDR or hot take below the previous take. If not, create a new entry for the article copying the format from a previous article + take.
4) Submit a PR to include your research. todo: Create a tutorial on submitting PRs to this repo and link this to the tutorial.
